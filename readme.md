Script Quiz
===========
This is a program that creates randomly generated questions based off of
a movie/film script that is given as input.

Format of Scripts
-----------------
All scripts that are inputed are expected to be of the following format:
  *All comment lines begin with "<". ">" is not required at the end of a line but does make it look nicer.
  *A Character must begin their dialogue with their name, followed by a ":", some number of TABS and then their dialogue
  *All subsequent lines of dialogue by character must begin with at least one TAB

**Examples** can be seen in the _scripts_ folder
