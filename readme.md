Script Quiz
===========
This is a program that creates randomly generated questions based off of a movie/film script that is given as input.

Currently, the program is setup to be specifically used for the one script currently available. Changes to the _main_
 function where _playQuiz_ is called can change: the title of the quiz, number of questions asked, the number of possible responses, and whether normal or hard difficulty is used.
 
Format of Scripts
-----------------
All scripts that are inputed are expected to be of the following format:
  * All comment lines begin with "<". ">" is not required at the end of a line but does make it look nicer.
  * A Character must begin their dialogue with their name, followed by a ":", some number of TABS and then their dialogue
  * All subsequent lines of dialogue by character must begin with at least one TAB

**Examples** can be seen in the _scripts_ folder
